# YOUTUBE SEARCH PAGE

## IN THIS APP I USED YOUTUBE API TO MAKE A SMALL VIDEO SEARCHING PAGE
In the searchbar type the keyword.
The googleapi used searched for the word and displayed the result and automatically starts the first video.
We can click on other videos displayed in the side bar to play it.

### App hierarchy is something like that:

Index -> App -> 1.SearchBar 2. VideoDetail + VideoList(->VideoItem)

### The styles are given by using semantic ui.
